# Day 7

## Problem Statement

Welcome to Day 7! Check out a video review of arrays here, or just jump right into the problem.

An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.

You'll be given an array of N integers, and you have to print the integers in reverse order.

Good luck!

## Input Format

The first line of input contains N, the number of integers. The next line contains N integers separated by a space.

## Constraints

1≤N≤1000
1≤Ai≤10000, where Ai is the ith integer in the array.

## Output Format

Print the N integers of the array in the reverse order on a single line separated by a space.

## Sample Input
```
4
1 4 3 2
```
## Sample Output
```
2 3 4 1
```
