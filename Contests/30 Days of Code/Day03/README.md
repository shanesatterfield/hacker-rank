# Day 3

## Problem Statement

Welcome to Day 3! Check out a review of if-else statements here, or just jump right into the problem.

Using "if-else" you can perform decision making in your code. See the flowchart below (taken from wikipedia):

This problem will test your knowledge on "if-else" statements.

Given an integer N as input, check the following:

If N is odd, print "Weird".  
If N is even and, in between the range of 2 and 5(inclusive), print "Not Weird".  
If N is even and, in between the range of 6 and 20(inclusive), print "Weird".  
If N is even and N>20, print "Not Weird".  
We have given you partially completed code in the editor, complete it to solve the problem.  

## Input Format

There is a single line of input: integer N.

## Constraints
```
1≤N≤100
```
## Output Format

Print "Weird" if the number is weird. Otherwise, print "Not Weird". Do not print the quotation marks.

## Sample Input 1
```
3
```
## Sample Output 1
```
Weird
```
## Explanation
N=3, is odd hence the its a Weird Number.

## Sample Input 2
```
24
```
## Sample Output 2
```
Not Weird
```
## Explanation
N=24, is >20 hence its not a Weird Number.
