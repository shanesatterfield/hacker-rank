# Project Euler #4: Largest palindrome product

This problem is a programming version of [Problem 4](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4) from [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/)

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The smallest 6 digit palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is 101101=143×707.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers which is less than N.

## Input Format
