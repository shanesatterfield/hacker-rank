# Day 10

## Problem Statement

Welcome to Day 10! Check out this video for a review of binary numbers, or just jump right into the problem.

For this challenge, convert a given number, n, from decimal (base 10) to binary (base 2).

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, T, the number of test cases. The T subsequent lines of test cases each contain a single value, n, the base 10 positive integer to be converted.

## Constraints
```
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ n ≤ 231
```
## Output Format

For each test case, print the value of n in binary on a new line.

## Sample Input
```
2
4
5
```
## Sample Output
```
100
101
```
## Explanation
```
Test Case 0: n=4 evaluates to 1 × 2^2 + 0 × 2^1 + 0 × 2^0 = 1 × 4 + 0 + 0 = 100.
Test Case 1: n=5 evaluates to 1 × 2^2 + 0 × 2^1 + 1 × 2^0 = 1 × 4 + 0 + 1 × 1 = 101.
