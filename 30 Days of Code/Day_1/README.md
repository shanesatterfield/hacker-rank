# Day 1

## Problem Statement

Welcome to Day 1! Check out the video tutorial here, or just jump right into the problem.

Let's talk about data types. In programming, a data type is a classification of types of data that determine the possible values and operations on that particular type.

Some typical examples of data types are:

- int
- double
- boolean
- char
- String
- Array

Remember, in languages like Java data types (like the ones above) can be classified into two main groups:

1. Primitive Types
2. Reference Types

For this challenge, consider the following inputs (you don't need to read any input):

- 5.35
- 'a'
- false
- 100
- "I am a code monkey"
- true
- 17.3
- 'c'
- "derp"

For each line above, print out if it is an instance of a primitive or referenced type as well as which data type it is (using the typical examples above).

Good luck!

Hint: In Java, String is a referenced type.

## Output Format

Output nine lines. Print one line for each of the input given above in the following format:
```
MainDataTypeOfInstance : SpecificDataTypeOfInstance
```
For example, if the input is:
```
123
```
Your output should be:
```
Primitive : int
```
Make sure you spell everything correctly and capitalize your entries. Also, don't forget spaces and colon in between the main and specific data types!
