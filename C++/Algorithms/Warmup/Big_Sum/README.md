# A Very Big Sum

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers of size N. You need to print the sum of the elements of the array.

Note: The range of the 32-bit integer is −231 to 231−1 or [−2147483648,2147483647]. When we add several integer values, the resulting sum might exceed this range. You might need to use long long int in C/C++ or long data type in Java to store such sums.

## Input Format

The first line of the input consists of an integer N. The next line contains N space-separated integers describing the array.

## Constraints
```
1≤N≤10
0≤A[i]≤1010
```
## Output Format

Output a single value equal to the sum of the elements of the array.
