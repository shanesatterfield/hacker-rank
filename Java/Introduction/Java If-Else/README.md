# Java If-Else

Using "if-else" you can perform decision making in Java. See the flowchart below (taken from wikipedia):

This problem will test your knowledge on "if-else" statements.

Given an integer N as input, check the following:

- If N is odd, print "Weird".
- If N is even and, in between the range of 2 and 5(inclusive), print "Not Weird".
- If N is even and, in between the range of 6 and 20(inclusive), print "Weird".
- If N is even and N>20, print "Not Weird".
- We given you partially completed code in the editor, complete it to solve the problem.

## Input Format

There is a single line of input: integer N.

## Constraints
```
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
```
## Output Format

Print "Weird" if the number is weird. Otherwise, print "Not Weird". Do not print the quotation marks.
