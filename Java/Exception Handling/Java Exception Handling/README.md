# Java Exception Handling

## Problem Statement

Create a class myCalculator which consists of a single method power(int,int). This method takes two integers, n and p, as parameters and finds n^p. If either n or p is negative, then the method must throw an exception which says "n and p should be non-negative".

Please read the partially completed code in the editor and complete it. Your code mustn't be public.

No need to worry about constraints, there won't be any overflow if your code is correct.

## Sample Input
```
3 5
2 4

-1 3
```
## Sample Output
