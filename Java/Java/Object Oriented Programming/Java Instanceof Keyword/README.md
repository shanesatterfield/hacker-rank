# Java Instanceof Keyword

The Java instanceof operator is used to test if the object or instance is an instanceof the specified type.

In this problem we have given you three classes in the editor, Student, Rockstar and Hacker. In the main function we populated an ArrayList with instances of these classes. count method counts how many instance of each type are present in the ArrayList. Some lines of the code are missing, and you have to fix it by modifying only 33 lines!
