# Java Loops I

## Objective
In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.

## Task
Given an integer, `N`, print its first `10` multiples. Each multiple `N x i` (where `i <= i <= 10` ) should be printed on a new line in the form: `N x i = result`.

## Input Format

A single integer, `N`.

## Constraints
`2 <= N <= 20`

## Output Format

Print `10` lines of output; each line `i` (where `1 <= i <= 10`) contains the of in the form: `N x i = result`.

## Sample Input
```
2
```

## Sample Output
```
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
2 x 6 = 12
2 x 7 = 14
2 x 8 = 16
2 x 9 = 18
2 x 10 = 20
```
