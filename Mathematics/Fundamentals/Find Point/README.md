# Find Point

## Problem Statement

Given two points P and Q, output the symmetric point of point P about Q.

## Input format:
The first line contains an integer T representing the number of testcases (T <= 15)
Each test case contains Px Py Qx Qy representing the (x,y) coordinates of P and Q, all of them being integers.

## Constraints
```
1 <= T <= 15
-100 <= x, y <= 100
```
## Output format
For each test case output x and y coordinates of the symmetric point (each point in a new line).

## Sample input
```
1  
0 0 1 1
```
## Sample output
```
2 2
```
