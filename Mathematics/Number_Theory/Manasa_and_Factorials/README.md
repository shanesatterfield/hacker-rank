# Manasa and Factorials

## Problem Statement

Manasa was sulking her way through a boring class when suddenly her teacher singled her out and asked her a question. He gave her a number n and Manasa has to come up with the smallest number m which contains atleast n number of zeros at the end of m!. Help Manasa come out of the sticky situation.

## Input Format
The first line contains an integer T i.e. the number of Test cases.
Next T lines will contain an integer n.

## Output Format
Print smallest such number m.

## Constraints
```
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ n ≤ 1016
```
## Sample Input
```
3
1
2
3
```
## Sample Output
```
5
10
15
```
## Explanation
As 4! = 24 and 5! = 120, so minimum value of m will be 5.  
As 9! = 362880 and 10! = 3628800, so minimum value of m will be 10.  
As 14! = 87178291200 and 15! = 1307674368000, so minimum value of m will be 15.
