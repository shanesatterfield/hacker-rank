# Validating Phone Numbers

## Problem Statement

Let's dive into the interesting topic of regular expressions! You are given some inputs and you are required to check whether they are valid mobile numbers.

A valid mobile number is a ten digit number starting with 7, 8 or 9.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer N followed by N lines, each containing some string.

## Output Format

For every string listed, print YES if it is a valid mobile number and NO if it isn’t.

## Constraints
```
1 <= N <= 10
Mobile Number contains valid alpha-numeric characters
2 <= len(Number) <= 15
```
## Sample Input
```
2
9587456281
1252478965
```
## Sample Output
```
YES
NO
```
## Concept

A valid mobile number is a ten digit number starting with 7, 8 or 9.
