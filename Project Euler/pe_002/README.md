# Project Euler #2: Even Fibonacci numbers

## Problem Statement

This problem is a programming version of Problem 2 from projecteuler.net

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
```
1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...
```

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed N, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Input Format
First line contains T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer, N.

## Output Format
Print the required answer for each test case.

## Constraints
```
1 ≤ T ≤ 105
10 ≤ N ≤ 4×10^16
```

## Sample Input
```
2
10
100
```
## Sample Output
```
